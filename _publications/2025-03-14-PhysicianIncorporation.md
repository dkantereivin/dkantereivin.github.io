excerpt: |
    - Investigates the impact of allowing physicians to incorporate professionally in Canada, enabling them to defer higher personal income taxes.
    - Uses a difference-in-differences approach to analyze cross-provincial policy timing and its effects on physician behavior.
    - Finds no evidence of increased service supply but observes modest increases in interprovincial migration and reduced emigration.
    - Highlights a 6.8% decline in total physician supply five years post-policy, driven by earlier retirements, especially among older physicians.

# Abstract
We investigate a policy of professional incorporation in Canada which allows physicians to defer higher personal income taxes. Incorporated physicians earn income now, but can shield it from high personal taxation by retaining it within their corporation. Shielded income can then be consumed during retirement when the physician is subject to lower personal income taxes. This alters incentives for labour supply over the career life cycle. Using a difference-in-differences econometric strategy and cross-provincial variation in policy timing we compare provinces that allowed incorporation to those that did not (first difference) before and after adoption of these policies (second difference). After incorporation, we find no evidence of intensive margin improvement in physiciansâ€™ supply of services or payments. Allowing incorporation modestly increases interprovincial migration and reduces emigration of physicians. However, five years post-implementation, we find a 6.8% decline in total physician supply and larger impacts among older physician cohorts, suggesting that the policy facilitated earlier retirement. Our findings highlight how these policies may have unintended long-term effects on physician supply through incentivizing retirement.
