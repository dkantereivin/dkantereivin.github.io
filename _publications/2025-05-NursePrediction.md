excerpt: |
    - Study evaluating how accurately ED triage nurses can predict patient hospital admissions, using data from 134,891 visits over five years.
    - Found 85.8% overall accuracy, with nurses better at identifying patients who don't need admission (93.7% specificity) than identifying those who do (36.6% sensitivity).
    - Results suggest nurse predictions could help expedite certain hospital admission decisions and improve ED patient flow, despite not being reliable enough for complete automation.

# Abstract
*Objective*: Emergency department (ED) flow could be improved with quicker disposition decisions. One possible way to expedite decisions is for triage nurses to make predictions about whether patients require admission to hospital. The information contained in these predictions could be useful for disposition planning and for physician decision making. Previous studies make use of prospective designs that introduce Hawthorne effects and have demonstrated mixed evidence on whether triage nurse predictions are accurate. We examined the accuracy of triage nurse predictions for patient admission in a southeastern Ontario ED site.

*Methods*: We examined a retrospective sample of 134,891 visits to an ED in Ontario from March 2019 to July 2024. Triage nurses made predictions about admission to hospital for these visits, from which we estimated measures of specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, accuracy, and $F_1$ scores.

*Results*: Of 134,891 visits, 13.7% resulted in hospital admission. We found the accuracy of the nurses in predicting admission to be 85.8% (95CI: 85.7, 86.1), while overall sensitivity was 36.6% (95CI: 35.9, 37.3) and specificity was 93.7% (95CI: 93.5, 93.8). The positive predictive value of admission was 47.9%  (95CI: 47.1, 48.7) and the negative predictive value of admission was 90.3% (95CI: 90.1, 90.5). F1 scores were 0.415. These results were relatively stable over time, though there was notable variation in prediction ability between nurses. We also report that some presenting conditions have relatively higher prediction accuracy than others and that as overall case severity increases, sensitivity increases and specificity decreases.

*Conclusions*: These results suggest that although nursing staff predictions are insufficient to streamline disposition decisions completely, they could be useful in expediting certain decisions related to hospital admission and resource requirement, improving flow in EDs.
